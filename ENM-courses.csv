Inferential statistics provide the means of generalizing to a population from a sample, thus enabling solutions and conclusions that otherwise would not be obtained. Modern software provides the leverage to tackle problems of realistic size and complexity. The concepts and methods covered have direct application to forecasting, queuing, inventory, production, scheduling, equipment replacement, reliability, availability, quality control, experimental design, robust engineering, six sigma, and more.
